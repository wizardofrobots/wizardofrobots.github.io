  abstract={Protein metamorphosis, where proteins undergo large-scale structural changes to perform different functions, is a fascinating phenomenon in structural biology. Understanding and predicting this behavior across proteomes remains a significant challenge. We present Morpheus, a novel fragment-based computational algorithm designed to predict metamorphic behaviour in proteins. Our approach enables systematic analysis of protein structural plasticity at the proteome scale, providing insights into functional diversity and structural dynamics. This work opens new avenues for understanding protein evolution and designing proteins with desired structural properties.},
