#### What is Morpheus?

Morpheus is a novel computational algorithm that we developed to predict metamorphic behaviour in proteins across entire proteomes. Protein metamorphosis is a fascinating phenomenon where proteins undergo large-scale structural changes to perform different functions.

#### Key Features

<ul>
    <li>Fragment-based prediction approach</li>
    <li>Proteome-scale analysis capability</li>
    <li>Insights into protein structural plasticity</li>
    <li>Applications in understanding functional diversity</li>
</ul>

This work represents a significant step forward in computational structural biology, enabling systematic analysis of protein dynamics and metamorphic transitions at an unprecedented scale.

#### Implications

Our algorithm opens new avenues for:

- Understanding protein evolution
- Designing proteins with desired structural properties
- Studying disease-related protein misfolding
- Exploring functional diversity in proteomes

> The ability to predict metamorphic behaviour could revolutionize our understanding of protein structure-function relationships and enable novel protein engineering approaches.
