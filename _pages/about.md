I am a BS-MS student at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Pune, specializing in **Biophysics**, **Bioinformatics**, **Synthetic Biology**, and **NMR Spectroscopy**.

My research interests lie at the intersection of computational biology and structural biophysics. I am particularly interested in understanding protein dynamics, metamorphic behavior, and developing computational algorithms to predict protein structural changes across proteomes.

I recently contributed to the development of **Morpheus**, a fragment-based algorithm designed to predict metamorphic behaviour in proteins. This work, published in bioRxiv (2025), represents a novel approach to understanding protein structural plasticity and functional diversity at the proteome scale.

Through my research, I aim to bridge computational methods with experimental biophysics to unravel the complex mechanisms governing protein structure and function.
